Hello, I am Jincheol Jung, a student majoring in Software Convergence at Kyung Hee University. I have worked as a research intern in the [System software LAB](https://ss.korea.ac.kr/), where I conducted research on container virtualization, cloud orchestration, and custom metric-based scaling techniques. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in real-time data processing through research in the [BIGDATA LAB]( http://allbigdata.khu.ac.kr/) on smart healthcare applications.

My research focuses on optimizing resource management across diverse application environments using federated learning, with the aim of enhancing cloud system performance and providing efficient scaling solutions. In the future, I hope to contribute to solving real-world problems in cloud-based distributed systems, making a positive impact in fields like energy and healthcare. Building on these experiences and my vision, I am eager to leverage advanced technologies to drive meaningful change.
