Hello, I am Jincheol Jung, a student majoring in Software Convergence at Kyung Hee University. During my time as a research intern at the [System software LAB](https://ss.korea.ac.kr/), I conducted studies on container virtualization/orchestration and custom metric-based scaling. Additionally, I gained practical experience in real-time data processing through research on smart healthcare applications at the [BIGDATA LAB]( http://allbigdata.khu.ac.kr/)

My research interests include cloud/edge computing, learning-based resource allocation and optimization, and federated learning. I aim to build intelligent cloud platform systems capable of meeting the performance requirements of next-generation services such as autonomous driving, automation, and AR/VR.
