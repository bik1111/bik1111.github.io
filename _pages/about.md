I'm Jincheol Jung. I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Convergence from Kyung Hee University. I worked as a research assistant in the [Operating System LAB](https://ss.korea.ac.kr/) led by Professor Gyeongsik Yang. I have also collaborated with Professor Changho Jhin, conducting research on smart healthcare in [BIGDATA LAB]( http://allbigdata.khu.ac.kr/). My research experiences motivated me to build and leverage cloud environments to make a positive impact. I'm inenterested in container virtualization/orchestration and Federated Learning.

Beyond academia, I find joy in contributing to others, pursuing perosnal growth, playing tennis and running. Sprots and self-improvement are a huge part of my life.
