Hello, I am Jincheol Jung, a student majoring in Software Convergence at Kyung Hee University. During my time as a research intern at the [System software LAB](https://ss.korea.ac.kr/), I conducted studies on container virtualization/orchestration and custom metric-based scaling. Additionally, I gained practical experience in real-time data processing through research on smart healthcare applications at the [BIGDATA LAB]( http://allbigdata.khu.ac.kr/)

My research interests include cloud/edge computing, learning-based resource allocation and optimization, and federated learning. I aim to build intelligent cloud platform systems capable of meeting the performance requirements of next-generation services such as autonomous driving, automation, and AR/VR.

      This study compares CPU-based and custom metric-based scaling methods in Kubernetes, showing that custom
      metrics tailored to application needs can enhance scalability and efficiency. Findings reveal that, at certain scaling
      thresholds under dynamic network traffic, custom metrics reduce average latency by 85% to 87% compared to
      CPU-based scaling.
