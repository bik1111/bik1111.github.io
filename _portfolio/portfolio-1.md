BatShu | A platform for sharing and trading dashcam footage, where rewards incentivize voluntary video submissions. Users can request or provide video content as needed. [GitHub](https://github.com/bik1111/BatShu-backend)

- Led and mentored a university freshman while managing the entire project from start to finish.
- Integrated AWS S3, Lambda, MediaConvert, and CloudFront to build an efficient, automated cloud-based streaming pipeline for optimized HLS video conversion and global delivery.
- Developed a license plate blurring feature using an [open-source]((https://github.com/tfaehse/DashcamCleaner)) YOLOv8-based tool, leveraging advanced object detection, tracking, and instance segmentation capabilities.
- Built a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Docker, enabling seamless automated deployment to AWS via GitHub Container Registry for consistent and efficient production updates.
