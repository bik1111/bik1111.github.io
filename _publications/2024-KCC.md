excerpt: 'In the current chat service market, real-time chat services based on open chat formats centered on specific topics and interests are gaining popularity, with the number of open chat users steadily increasing. Consequently, domestic IT companies are prioritizing the expansion of open chat functionalities as a core business strategy to invigorate community engagement. However, since the performance of chat services heavily depends on the messaging system used in development, companies face challenges in selecting a library that satisfies both service performance optimization and cost efficiency. This paper compares and analyzes the performance of gRPC and ZeroMQ, which are applicable in distributed system environments, from the perspective of chat service implementation. Through this paper, we aim to contribute to the design and implementation of more efficient chat services, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction'

In the contemporary chat service industry, the scope of online chat services is progressively expanding to include interest-based communities for sharing personal tastes, as well as one-on-one chat services like those found on fandom platforms. This evolution in chat services is significantly impacting the content industry, which is one of the most popular areas of interest. For instance, Naver's 'OpenTalk' service saw approximately 2.78 million users during the Qatar World Cup period. In response to the growing chat service market, IT companies like Naver and Kakao are increasingly considering the expansion of open chat functionalities as part of their strategies to enhance community engagement. The expansion of chat services requires complex system designs, highlighting the importance of efficient data processing and communication, particularly in distributed system environments. Despite the availability of various messaging systems, there is a lack of specific research elucidating their performance differences. This paper addresses this gap by comparing and analyzing the performance of gRPC, an HTTP/2 protocol-based Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework, and ZeroMQ, which operates over pure TCP and offers various messaging patterns. Through this comparison, we aim to provide insights that aid in the design and implementation of more efficient chat services, ultimately contributing to increased user satisfaction.
