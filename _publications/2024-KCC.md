title: "Performance Comparison Analysis of gRPC and zeroMQ for Efficient Library Selection in Chat Service Development"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-KCC
excerpt: 'In the current chat service market, real-time chat services based on open chat formats centered on specific topics and interests are gaining popularity, with the number of open chat users steadily increasing. Consequently, domestic IT companies are prioritizing the expansion of open chat functionalities as a core business strategy to invigorate community engagement. However, since the performance of chat services heavily depends on the messaging system used in development, companies face challenges in selecting a library that satisfies both service performance optimization and cost efficiency. This paper compares and analyzes the performance of gRPC and ZeroMQ, which are applicable in distributed system environments, from the perspective of chat service implementation. Through this paper, we aim to contribute to the design and implementation of more efficient chat services, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction'
