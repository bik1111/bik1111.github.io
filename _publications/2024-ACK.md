excerpt: 'This study compares CPU-based and custom metric-based scaling methods in Kubernetes, showing that custom metrics tailored to application needs can enhance scalability and efficiency. Findings reveal that, at certain scaling thresholds under dynamic network traffic, custom metrics reduce average latency by 85% to 87% compared to CPU-based scaling'

Effective resource management is vital in cloud environments to optimize performance and costs. Kubernetesâ€™ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) scales applications based on metrics like CPU usage, but it has limitations with diverse application needs and complex workloads. These limitations are especially noticeable when specific metrics, such as request latency, are crucial for performance. Custom metric-based scaling, using metrics like network traffic or requests per second, enables more precise resource allocation suited to application demands, such as real-time streaming. This study compares CPU-based and custom metric-based scaling in Kubernetes, showing that custom metrics can greatly enhance performance and efficiency, especially in latency-sensitive applications with dynamic workloads. The goal is to demonstrate how custom metrics provide an optimized solution for complex cloud environments.
